# Privacy Policy – URL Shortener

**Last updated: January 31, 2026**

This Privacy Policy describes how the **URL Shortener** application handles the information provided by users while using the application.

---

## 1. Data used by the application

The application uses exclusively the information entered by the user:

- The original URL provided for shortening  
- The shortened URL returned by the shortening service

This data is used solely to enable the application to function and to display to the user a history of previously shortened links.

---

## 2. Data sent to third-party service

To perform URL shortening, the application sends the address provided by the user to a third-party service:

**Service used:** encurtador.dev

The application acts only as an intermediary between the user and this service. The processing of information by the external API is subject to the privacy policy of **encurtador.dev**, over which the developer of this application has no control.

---

## 3. Local storage

The application maintains a local database on the user’s device to store:

- Original URLs entered  
- Generated shortened links  
- Date of shortening

This information:

- Is stored only on the user’s own device  
- Is not sent to the developer’s servers  
- Is not shared with third parties other than the shortening API  
- Can be individually removed by the user through the delete button available on each item in the history  
- Is completely removed if the application is uninstalled

---

## 4. Data we DO NOT collect

The application does **not** collect:

- Name, email, phone number, or documents  
- Location data  
- Device identifiers  
- Contacts  
- Usage analytics  
- Cookies  
- Any personal information beyond the URLs entered by the user

---

## 5. Permissions

The application only uses internet access to communicate with the shortening API and **does not request sensitive permissions** such as:

- Camera  
- Location  
- Contacts  
- External storage

---

## 6. Responsibilities

The user is responsible for the content of the URLs submitted for shortening. The application has no access to the content of the provided websites and is not responsible for the way the third-party service (encurtador.dev) handles this information.

---

## 7. Changes to this policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect changes in the application. Users are encouraged to review this document periodically.
